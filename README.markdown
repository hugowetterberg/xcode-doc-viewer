I really hate that there isn't a separate Doc reader for the Apple Developer
Documentation. What this script does is to create a copy of Xcode that you can
use solely for reading the docs. The copy is named DocViewer and is given the
icon that's used by Dictionary.app.

Usage
===============

$ bash DocViewer.sh
